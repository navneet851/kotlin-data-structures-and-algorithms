## Array
There are two main types of arrays:
### One-dimensional arrays
**An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations. It’s one of the most popular and simple data structures and is often used to implement other data structures. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0 . Each element in an array is accessed through its index.**

### Multidimensional arrays
#### Two-dimensional Array
**A two-dimensional array or 2D array in C is the simplest form of the multidimensional array. We can visualize a two-dimensional array as an array of one-dimensional arrays arranged one over another forming a table with ‘x’ rows and ‘y’ columns where the row number ranges from 0 to (x-1) and the column number ranges from 0 to (y-1).**

### Need of Array Data Structures
Arrays are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

* Storing data for processing
* Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues
* Representing data in tables and matrices
* Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees

### Types of Array
There are two main types of arrays:

**One-dimensional arrays:** These arrays store a single row of elements.</br>
**Multidimensional arrays:** These arrays store multiple rows of elements.
Array Operations

### Common operations performed on arrays include:

**Traversal :** Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g., sequential, reverse).</br>
**Insertion :** Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.</br>
**Deletion :** Removing an element from an array at a specific index.</br>
**Searching :** Finding the index of an element in an array.</br>
