## Graph
Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(V, E).

Graph data structures are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing complex relationships between objects or entities. They are particularly useful in fields such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and computer networks. In the field of sports data science, graph data structures can be used to analyze and understand the dynamics of team performance and player interactions on the field.

### Operations on Graphs:
- Basic Operations:

  * **Insertion of Nodes/Edges** in the graph – Insert a node into the graph.
  * **Deletion of Nodes/Edges** in the graph – Delete a node from the graph.
  * **Searching on Graphs** – Search an entity in the graph.
  * **Traversal of Graphs** – Traversing all the nodes in the graph.

- More Operations:

  * **Shortest Paths** : From a source to a destination, a source to all other nodes and between all pairs.
  * **Minimum Spanning Tee** : In a weighted, connected undirected graph, finding the minimum weight edges to connect all.
