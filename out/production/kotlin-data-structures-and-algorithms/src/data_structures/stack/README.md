## Stack 

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It behaves like a stack of plates, where the last plate added is the first one to be removed.

#### Think of it this way:

* Pushing an element onto the stack is like adding a new plate on top.<br>
* Popping an element removes the top plate from the stack.

### Key Operations on Stack Data Structures
- **push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **IsFull**: Checks if the stack is full (in case of fixed-size arrays).
